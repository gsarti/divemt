ara_t1	ara	4			2.0	4.0	4	5.0	5	4.0	5.0	2.0	5	4.0	5	4	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	Sometimes, post editing limits my ability with its translation and didn't give me a space for creativity. On other times, it helps me to do my work faster if the translation is good and doesn't require a lot of work. So, I think post-editing is a way to help if it provides good translation.	I met some technical issues in using this tool. Sometimes, it didn't save the file after finishing, so I had to translate it again. Also, in post-editing files I met a problem in selecting some words to replace. So, I had to delete the whole sentence and write it again.	1420
ara_t2	ara	4			7.0	7.0	7	2.0	3	7.0	3.0	4.0	4		4	4	5	2	4	7	4	4	1	1	Post editing doesn't take a lot of time in typing than translation from scratch.	In some cases it was hard to point the typing indicator at specific place to add or delete letters or words, where there were no way except copying the translation and editing it in a word sheet then copying it and paste in the tool.	807
ara_t3	ara	6			6.0	4.0	2	2.0	6	6.0	4.0	7.0	4	2.0	6	4	1	5	6	3	7	3	3	6	Post-editing was less time consuming as it saved time of typing the translation from scratch. It also helped to some extent with terminology.		558
ita_t1	ita	6	1.0	Because a few segments contained a more literal output which instead needed to be reworked in order for the sentences to be grammatically correct or make sense.			4		4				4		4	6	2	5	5	2	5	2	3	5	Obviously I liked the fact the post-editing process was quicker and easier except for a few segments that needed some reworking. On the other hand, translation from scratch required more attention and more typing effort, but allowed more freedom of interpreting the sentences.		1853
ita_t4	ita	4	1.0	In some cases, the MT engine output was of good enough quality that it didn't require much editing.	3.0	4.0	6	3.0	6	5.0	5.0	6.0	3	4.0	4	3	4	5	5	6	6	2	6	4	The main reason is the need to look for errors in the target text. The MTPE requires a greater cognitive effort because it is necessary to correct an output, a translation already done, as well as interpret and translate the message of the source text. Translating from scratch, on the other hand, requires less cognitive effort as the ST is translated and the TT is reviewed by the translator itself, so the chances of serious errors (syntax, concordance, terminology, consistency, additions, omissions, mistranslations) are lower.		888
ita_t5	ita	6	1.0	Literal/wrong translation	3.0	7.0	4	1.0	7	3.0	3.0	3.0	7	3.0	6	5	3	5	4	4	5	4	4	5	MT translation is faster and mostly correct.	Typos were frequent in MT	212
nld_t1	nld	5	1.0	Some MT translations were of high quality (in terms of accuracy, grammar, etc.), while others were very poor or even almost incomprehensible.	2.0	2.0	5	2.0	6	6.0	3.0	1.0	4	1.0	5	5	3	6	3	6	5	3	3	4	Post-editing is generally faster, which is obviously positive, but only if the quality of the translation is good. Editing a translation of poor quality can be more time-consuming than translating from scratch. In addition, correcting ridiculous errors that only a machine would make can also be frustrating work.		1056
nld_t2	nld	6			5.0	5.0	4	3.0	4	4.0	3.0	2.0	1	1.0	6	6	5	6	5	5	6	6	7	5	Doubts whether the translation is good enough and not too litteral		248
nld_t3	nld	6		The quality was generally quite good for MT output. There were some of the common recurring MT issues, such as some terms not being right for the specific context and some more complex sentences not retaining their structure, but I have seen much worse. There were quite a few MT outputs that only needed polishing.	5.0	4.0	3	1.0	4	5.0	2.0	2.0	6	1.0	6	4	3	6	3	4	4	3	4	3	Generally the MT's high quality made for a smooth translation experience. On the other hand, because the MT was relatively good, I did tend to stick more to it, which led to my first draft being too literal and thus requiring more revision. In the end MT was faster and easier, but translating from scratch still has advantages too.		1035
tur_t1	tur	6	1.0	Quality of pre-translated segments varies significantly in terms of accuracy and fluency. Some MT results were accurate and quite comprehensible, only required little tweaks in grammar and fluency. Some were entirely off, needed to be translated from scratch. It was quite clear that different engines were used.	4.0	6.0	4	3.0	2	6.0	2.0	3.0	3	1.0	5	5	5	6	5	7	5	5	6	4	I'd prefer translating from scratch because I believe I work faster that way. Forming the source meaning in the target language feels easier than reading a translation of questionable quality and assessing if and where it needs improvements. I also believe that I can come up with more fluent translations without MT.		1635
tur_t2	tur	5	1.0	Some MT translations significantly differed in quality.	3.0	2.0	7	2.0	7	3.0	3.0	2.0	3	7.0	5	2	5	4	4	5	5	3	5	4	MT can save a lot of time in some incidents. Still, MT translation usually fails to find the best terminology in texts with wide variety of subjects, therefore, as the post-editor I should carefully scan the machine translated text to find the minor differences in meaning according the context. When translating from scratch, as the translator I am not preconditioned with the machine translated text and therefore, able to be more creative.		1358
tur_t3	tur	4	1.0	Because rather similar sentence structures and terms were translated almost completetly differently in different files. I am not entirely sure but it felt like different MT engines were involved.	7.0	4.0	5	2.0	4	7.0	2.0	2.0	3	1.0	3	3	7	4	4	5	7	1	7	2	Translating from scratch come easier to do and it takes less time, especially compared to an MT output to be post-edited is poor. Generally, as a seasoned translator I feel more productive when I am translating from scratch.		870
ukr_t1	ukr	5		The overall quality and type of flaws in pretranslations were noticeably different sometimes.	2.0	3.0	4	2.0	5	5.0	3.0	2.0	3	1.0	4	5	7	5	7	5	7	6	7	5	In post-editing, I may overlook words with contextually inappropriate translation (but otherwise correct), so I have to reread and recheck the sentence twice or more to catch all of them, while in translating from scratch I compose the whole sentence with adequate terms at once. Also, very often a more or less adequate translation in post-editing requires changing numerous endings and word order inaccuracies, and you may not always correctly estimate if wouldn't be faster to type (and compose) everything from scratch.		1967
ukr_t2	ukr	4	1.0	"The quality of the MT suggestions was obviously different. Some suggestions were downright unintelligible while others were quite good. In addition, the way quotation marks were suggested was also different. Some MT engine couldn't even place them the right way (it just put them before the word, such as """" forest, not ""forest"")."	6.0	3.0	5	2.0	2	6.0	4.0	2.0	2	1.0	3	3	4	2	5	2	6	3	6	2	Sometimes MT suggestions look well worded and you might be tempted to keep them as they are but they may contain major errors so you can't rely on them and should always double-check. In some cases, especially when sentences are short, MT output may not require editing at all.		1047
ukr_t3	ukr	6	1.0	The machine translation quality is different for different files. And even somewhat inconsistent within one file.	1.0	2.0	1	1.0	3	1.0	1.0	1.0	4	3.0	5	5	3	5	3	4	3	6	4	5	Like: I have the skeleton of the translation before I start to translate. No need to type the obvious words and punctuation and, sometimes, look up uncommon words in the dictionary. Dislike: I am somewhat forced to use the template provided by MT, it requires more effort to re-phrase the translation or hone the style.	The translation tool is not convenient compared to professional tools - no translation memory, thesaurus, termbase, spell checker, QA tools, I had to re-translate a file two or three times because it was not saved properly or auto-saved. If you open a file in two instances, then translate and save it in one instance, and then close the second instance, you may lose the translation.	763
vie_t1	vie	6	1.0	Because I found the translation sometimes likes Google, sometimes not.	3.0	4.0	4	3.0	4	4.0	4.0	2.0	4	1.0	4	4	5	6	5	6	5	5	7	6	The post editing sometimes is not correct enough with some omissions, and I have to sometimes translate from scratch. 		471
vie_t2	vie	5		There is no grounds to confirm.	4.0	2.0	4	1.0	1	3.0	3.0	1.0	2	1.0	5	5	3	5	0	3	4	4	6	3	Like: - Provide a general idea about the topic, save time to scan the contents. Good at some field, such as sports, politics. Dislike: - Limit creativity and ability of word choice Efford to delete in case of the bad ones.	"I found that last time I may misunderstand the question ""What specific language related issues cause the most serious and frequent problems?"", which is quite confusing, this time, I think the specific language related issues cause the most serious and frequent problems in Machine Translation, while last time, I answer with the idea that I evaluate my translation."	992
vie_t3	vie	6	1.0	Because the quality of the MT output varies significantly.	5.0	5.0	5	3.0	2	4.0	5.0	1.0	6	1.0	6	6	4	5	1	2	3	2	5	4	- inaccurate translations of culture-related elements wrong translations of complex structures loss in stylistic values in more stylistic contents		275
