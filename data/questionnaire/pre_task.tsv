It is very useful with texts in technical, general, and non-specialist texts. However, post-editor must be very careful as the machine is not always consistent and sometimes the translation is irrelevant.  	274

MT is very useful for technical, straightforward and/or simple texts. It can save a lot of time when translating content for IT and manuals, especially when the MT uses a project-specific glossary. It is much less useful for more creative texts such as marketing, or content with more complex sentences, as it tends to lose sight of the grammatical structure fairly quickly. Generally, MT can also be used as a quick translation tool for individual terms, even if the rest of the sentence is unusable; expressions tend to be translated too literally, though.	15314

The skill set it requires is similar to that of translation/proofreading. The main difference is that a translator/proofreader needs to have deep knowledge of both the source and target language, while, depending on the content of the post-editing project it is sufficient for a post-editor to have strong knowledge of the target language and of the specific domain, with a working knowledge of the source language. Even though it may reduce the overall translation costs and thus my personal income, personally I find post-editing jobs enjoyable, since they require me to solve errors.	255892

It saves vast amounts of time and nowadays is a must-have option for big projects and repetitive work. It also helps a lot to maintain the consistence of translations.  But it is still required to check and post-edit the translations provided by neural networks, as they are not always accurate and sometimes do not convey the emotional sides of the text, and it also happens that they change the sense to the opposite. I also sometimes feel not comfortable because I realize that sometimes soon I may easily be replaced by a computer at my workplace and will have to look for another job. But that is what progress is, so I must get along with that.	1178

Freelance translator full time	C1	More than 2 and less than 5	Yes	Less than 2	Less than 20%	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	Machine translation can be very helpful in some cases when the source content is repetitive and/or has simple and straightforward structures and expressions, etc. In such cases, machine translated content can be pretty accurate and post-editing work can be done faster than translating from scratch. When the source content is more of creative type or uses idiomatic/stylistic expressions, etc., MT often produces too literal targets and loses the style and subtle nuances of the source. Besides, working on post-editing MT too often may affect the creativity of translators as the brain are used to being given content to modify instead of creating its own translation. However, in some cases, MT can provide great ideas for specific words and expressions since the data used to feed algorithms comes from various minds around the world.	10705
